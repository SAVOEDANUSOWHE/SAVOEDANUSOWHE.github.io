        <p><b>Lagos State is located on the South-Western part of Nigeria.<br>Lagos State was created on May 27th, 1967 by virue of State<br>(Creation and Transitional Provisions) Decree No.14 of 1967<br>which restructured Nigeria's Federation into 12 States.<br> Prior to this, Lagos Municipality had been administered by<br> the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos<br>Affairs as the regional authority while the Lagos City<br> Council (LCC) governed the City of Lagos. The metropolitan areas<br>(Colony Province) of Agege, Badagry, Epe, Ikeja, Ikorodu, and Mushin<br>were administered by the Western Region. The State took off<br>as an administrative entity on April 1st, 1968 with Lagos Island<br>serving the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital.<br>However, with the creation of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja<br>in 1976, Lagos ceased to be capital of the state which was move to Ikeja.<br>Equally, with the formal relocation of the seat of the Federal<br> Governement to Abuja on 12th December, 1991, Lagos ceased to be<br>Nigeria's political capital. Nevertheless, Lagos remains the nation's<br> economic and commercial capital. According to extant political records,<br>Lagos was, to the people of Nigeria, what the head is to the body of an individual.<br>Although Lagos State is the smallest State in land mark in Nigeria,<br>yet it has the highest population and economic wise.<br>Lagos State is inhabited by the Awori and Ogu (Egun) in Badagry and Ikeja<br>Divisions respectively, with the Ogus (Eguns) being found mainly in Badagry.<br>While the indigenous population of Lagos are Aworis, there is,<br>nevertheless, an admixture of other pioneer immigrant settlers.<br> The indigenes of Epe and Ikorodu Divisions are mainly the Ijebus<br>with pockets of Eko-Awori settlers along the coastland and riverine areas.<br>Whilst the State is essentially a Yoruba-speaking environment,<br>it is, nevertheless, a socio-cultural melting pot attracting both Nigerians<br>and foreigners alike. The situation is attributable to its sound economic base<br>and socio-political importance which induced a high rate of rural-urban migration<br>to the State metropolitan region. Lagos State is made up of five administrative divisions,<br>namely Badagry,Epe,Ikeja,Ikorodu and Lagos-Island(Eko) popularly known as (IBILE).<br>The Divisions were created in May 1968 by virtue of the promulgatoin<br>of Administrative Divisions (Establishment) Edict No.3 of April 1968.<br>The divisions are further divided into 20 Local Governement areas in order<br>to bring good governace, development and participatory democracy nearer to grassroot people.<br><br><br> These are the 20 Local Governement and there code.
